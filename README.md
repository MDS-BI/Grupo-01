# ERP Software Base Module (Vite + Vanilla JS)

Minimal single-page app serving as an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software base module. It provides the common foundation for building custom ERP modules: master data management (Entities) and linked transactional documents (Documents) with create/edit/delete/search, screen navigation, validation, and browser localStorage persistence — using Vite and vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Setup

Install dependencies and run the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 (or the URL Vite prints).

## Tests

Run the full test suite (unit + integration) with:

```bash
npm test
```

Or a one-off run without watch mode:

```bash
npx vitest run
```

## Building Custom Modules

Custom ERP modules built on this base define:

- What an **Entity** represents (e.g., customer, product, asset) plus domain-specific fields.
- What a **Document** represents (e.g., order, invoice, contract).
- Module-specific labels and validation rules.

The base module handles identity generation, timestamps, referential integrity between entities and documents, cascade deletion, navigation, and search. See `specs/001-erp-base-module/` for the full specification.

## Tailoring via Configuration

All tailoring lives in one place: the `userConfig` object at the top of `src/module-config.js`. Developers edit this single export; no core code changes are required. Available knobs:

- `moduleName` — display name shown in headings and the document title.
- `labels` — rename Entity/Document terms across every screen (`entity`, `entities`, `document`, `documents`, plus verb labels).
- `customFields` — declare extra fields per record type with `target` (`entity` or `document`), `key`, `label`, `type` (`text`, `number`, `date`, or `select`), optional `required`, and `options` for selects. Values persist alongside records and appear in search results.
- `statusLifecycle` — restrict document statuses to a configured list of `statuses` with permitted `transitions` between them. Without it, status stays a free-form field.

If the configuration is invalid (unknown types, bad keys, transitions referencing unknown statuses), the app shows the problems in a banner and falls back to defaults instead of breaking.

## Notes

- Data is persisted to `localStorage` under the keys `erp_base_module:entities` and `erp_base_module:documents`.
- Deleting an entity also deletes its documents (cascade).
- This project intentionally uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for simplicity.
